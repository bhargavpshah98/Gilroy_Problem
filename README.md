CITY OF GILROY
ERP RFP

Section 1 - Introduction

SDI Presence, LLC (SDI) generated this document, titled Information Technology (IT) Strategic Plan, for 
the City of Gilroy (City) to describe the process utilized to develop the City's IT Strategic Plan and the 
results of the planning endeavor. The IT Strategic Plan will allow the City to effectively allocate its 
information technology resources and reap more advantages from its information technology expenditures. 
The plan does not attempt to predict the future; rather, it provides both a process and a baseline to enable 
the City to more effectively respond to new and/or changing requirements by proactively adapting 
processes, organization, people, and infrastructure, in conjunction with the establishment of a more 
thorough process for the governance of the City-wide use of information technology.

				    		Methodology for Strategic IT

Section 2 – Executive Summary

SDI developed the City of Gilroy's Information Technology (IT) Strategic Plan after a lengthy process 
of data collection, analysis, collaboration, and review, which included interviews and workshops. 
Information technology infrastructure, business applications, and services, as well as an assessment 
of the City's ability to govern, manage, and deliver information technology services, were key 
components of this process. The information technology assessment included a series of interviews 
with key user stakeholders and City management team members to identify the technologies in use,
 issues with the technologies and/or support for them, and future plans, as well as an analysis of how 
closely the City's practices and procedures adhere to a set of IT best practices. Section 3, City's 
Current IT Environment (below) contains more information regarding the IT Assessment's results;
However, the assessment found that the City's compliance with IT best practices is lacking.
The City's compliance with IT best practices (43%) is close to the average (45%) for similar engagements completed by SDI for local governments in the state, as well as the threshold for proactive companies (50 percent ). The IT Assessment Report's findings and suggestions are intended to help the City of Gilroy maintain current service levels while enhancing best practice adherence to a level that reflects a proactive organization.





Section 3 – IT Company Background

Strengths
Executive support for the strategic use of information technology to deliver services to the community,
a capable and engaged IT organization (but understaffed), and departments that are more than ready
 to take on the challenges associated with the replacement of key business applications are among 
the City's strengths. The technology infrastructure of the city appears to be relatively secure and 
reliable. The City is also fortunate in having sufficient financial resources to replace essential 
business software such as the Finance/HR, Land Management, Work Order and Asset Management, 
and Records Management systems.


Weaknesses
The City of Gilroy does not have a formal process for information technology governance at a strategic
 level, and the City's GIS system (which is critical to the successful implementation of new land 
management and asset management systems) has languished because it has no sponsor or 
owner in the City. The City's business resilience strategy is lacking, while ITD personnel is insufficient 
and compliance with IT best practices (which would allow ITD to easily scale up staffing) is not as 
excellent as it could be. ITD has had to focus on "firefighting" rather than progressively mitigating 
the root causes of user problems and implementing many of the information technology best practices 
that will help the organization survive for years to come due to limited staffing and budget, and 
the City does not have a comprehensive approach to user training.


Opportunities
The City will be able to better allocate user and IT resources as a result of the implementation of 
a formal approach to enterprise IT governance, ensuring that critical business objectives and 
priorities are met and that the operational impact of replacing key business applications is managed
and minimized. ITD should be able to establish a program for continuous improvement as a result
of its continued adoption of IT best practices, allowing it to meet rising user and public expectations. 
The city should also consider migrating some on-premises IT services to cloud settings, with the 
goal of simplifying business resilience measures and allowing ITD to focus on the city's most 
pressing issues.


Threats
The single greatest concern facing the City is that unless many of the City's important business
applications are replaced quickly and successfully, the costs of maintaining the current application 
environment will continue to rise while the City's return on those costs decreases. Despite the 
users' commitment to change, the City's heritage of siloed organizations, different information 
systems, and different repositories of information will hinder its capacity to fully reap the benefits 
of new business applications without enterprise IT governance. Taking on too many projects at 
once increases the likelihood of operational interruption and project failure. Finally, the City's 
information technology assets will be jeopardized without a more comprehensive approach to 
cyber-security planning, monitoring, and education.


Section 4:- IT Technology Trends

The adoption of "Smart City" technologies is unusual in that it represents an integrated approach to the use of emerging information technologies and technology trends that enable local governments to more effectively identify trends (such as incidents, traffic, power demand, parking space availability, and so on), re-allocate or reprogram government resources in response to these trends, and support p Despite the fact that SDI considers "Smart Cities" to be an emergent rather than mainstream trend, it is fast maturing as a result of communities' desire to maximize the use of assets and facilities, as well as public expectations. Members of the community and visitors can benefit from smart city capabilities by being able to access information about employment, public safety, healthcare, social services, transit, and driving via smartphone apps.

Section 5:- Development of IT Strategic Plans

Organizations can use strategic planning to strike a balance between present and long-term needs. As a result, the process of developing a strategic plan must take into account the same issues. Change is a perennial cause of stress for public sector executives, who must frequently adjust to growing public expectations and new requirements while working with limited resources and inflexible information technology settings. Organizations who do not have an Information Technology Strategic Plan to use as a baseline for managing and responding to change are more likely to become reactive rather than proactive, resulting in lower returns on their IT investments.

Project List:- 
The project list was compiled using data gathered during interviews with key City stakeholders, information provided by ITD's manager and staff, and the conclusions and suggestions contained in the IT Assessment Report. All of the stakeholders invited to the Planning and Prioritization Workshop were given the project list, and they provided updates and revisions.

Planning and Prioritization:-
SDI presented a briefing to familiarize the participants with the IT Assessment findings, the Project List, the workshop objectives and methodology, and the ground rules. The participants then went through a voting exercise to identify the City's highest priority projects, changed and added projects as needed (including adding projects to improve the speed and reliability of the City's Internet connection, establish a data warehouse for CCTV inspection video, and implement a registration system for the Senior Center), and revised the preliminary timeline. The results of the planning session are depicted in Figure 8, Blue Wall Following Workshop. Please note that the handwritten placards indicate initiatives that participants added, while the green dots represent the results of a voting procedure in which each participant was given four green dots to vote for.



Section 6:- Conclusion

Create a common understanding of the existing state of the City's information technology environment, including infrastructure, business applications, the City's ability to manage and deliver information technology services, and unmet needs. Establish a shared vision for where the City's information technology environment should be in the future, while keeping in mind that, even as the vision was being developed, emerging trends in information technology and public expectations for access to City information and services were evolving and changing the requirements. Create a roadmap that will allow the city to transition its information technology environment from where it is now to where it needs to be in the future.
